# YASS!
Yet Another Space Station!

## How Is This Different/Better?

1. Core code and server code will be completely independant. This will make writing your own server stuff super simple and the game itself run like butter.
2. Extremely high commit standards. Pull requests will be automatically declined. You must email me first and discuss the change. We're a community, but this is a delicate machine and needs a lot of care to have any chance of lasting forever like it'll need to.
3. License is a lot better than the absolute mess the current Space Station iterations are burdened with. Guarantees all free forever! (unless you annoy me personally)
