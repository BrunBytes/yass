# YASS!
Yet Another Space Station! Reimplementing Space Station in Rust this time. I've been doing a lot of tinkering and think this would be a fun project.

## How Is This Different/Better?

I'm not sure it will be to be honest. Mostly I just love engineering games, but hate the design/music/art....all those sorts of things. By making something that's already been designed it makes my task a lot more interesting (to me) and allows me to focus on solving the problems I care about. The licensing will embrace this mindset as well, focusing on education and broad permissions with regard to sharing the source code.

I have a few goals with the project which is why I've gone with Rust. A lot of it is I think this is a game with a huge potential for optimizations and solving problems in an interesting way. Also the rendering side (easily my least favourite domain) should be fairly constrained. I'm going to be testing out a new paradigm I'm calling *zero cost expressions*, e.g thinking not in terms of encapsulation, data orientated design but as a set of algebras to solve.
