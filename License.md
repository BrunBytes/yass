# The YASS License:

**This software is distributed with absolutely no warranty.**

## Double Freed Software

This software is released with the ultimate goal of preserving the **double freed-oms**. These are as follows:

1. **Free as in FREE BEER!!** - The software can never be sold for profit. You can however ask for financial support seperately to develop the software (e.g a Patreon). This can never allow for in-game content or special perks related to the software. 
2. **Free as in free speech (less exciting!)** - The software must have the source code available, free to modify and distribute as you desire. The software must also not contain any form of DRM. (sorry steam users!)

These are the double free-doms, as decreed. **This License must be present in any derived software, either with partial files or the complete program** - *It's copyleft baby*.

## Extra Clarifications

Since I'm not a lawyer, here's a couple of other extra edge cases to cover me:

1. I, **the original publisher**, are allowed to modify this license however I so choose. This is referred to as the **Benevolent Dictator For Life Priviledge**. I can choose a successor for this right in my passing or retirement, in any manner of my choosing.
2. If you use this software to provide a service (e.g hosting a game server) - you most certainly have the right to refuse any bad actors or connectors the service of playing your game. Ban all the idiots you desire.
3. This is a software only license, it does not apply to game assets like art etc. Probably creative commons attribution non-commercial would be the best choice for those.

Cheers all, enjoy your free Spessmans. :)
