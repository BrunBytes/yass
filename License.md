# The YASS License:

**This software is distributed with absolutely no warranty.**

## Motivation

Writing software should be a pleasure, and sadly that has been lost in recent times. That beautiful cleverness has been lost to overbearing complexity through encapsulation, or too much information low level nonsense. It should be a pleasure to read and write, made with care and a love for solving real problems. In order to satisfy these constraints software must be free to read, free to write and free to execute.  

## Double Freed Software

This software is released with the ultimate goal of preserving the **double freed-oms**. These are as follows:

1. **Free as in FREE BEER!!** - The software can never be sold for profit.
2. **Free as in free speech (less exciting!)** - The software must have the source code available, free to modify and distribute as you desire.

You are however free to accept payment/sponsorship to continue developing the software - just not allowed to charge for the source code or executables standalone. This license is copyleft and all derived software will share the same license.

This makes no comment on hosting this software as a service - you are free to charge for connections to that in order to cover pratical means such as server costs. However because all the software is double-freed someone can easily run their own service.
